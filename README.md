# 3053C_Final_Project

HOW TO USE:

To use this program, make sure the folder containing the images/dataset is in the "path" so Matlab can recognize it. Next, simply run the code, select the dataset you would like to test, and hit enter. The program will then output each image before and after going through the algorithm, a graphical representation of the data and a chart showing information about each file.

To prove that the program works, I created an answer key to show that the program was getting the correct results. Dataset4 is an incorrect version of dataset1 to show the error fixing functionality of the program.

To expand this program to test other images, simply add the images to another data set (as shown in line 20). Currently, the program can only test 10 images at a time. Future iterations of the program will increase this 10 file/image limit.

Enjoy!
